> A Github Action to build, push, and deploy using OpenFaaS

## Why?

This action is based on [this](https://github.com/mrsimpson/action-openfaas-build) project. The creator mentioned that they were keeping their action simple and not adding extra parameters. I created this action to have more control over the resulting image's version tag, in order to automate version bumping.
